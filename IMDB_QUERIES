Bolly Movies, an Indian film production company, has a successful track record of producing numerous blockbuster films. While primarily catering to the Indian audience, they have decided to venture into the global market with their upcoming project scheduled for release in 2022.

Objective:
Recognizing the value of data-driven decision-making, Bolly Movies has enlisted your expertise as a data analyst and SQL specialist. The objective of this case study is to analyse the movie dataset using SQL queries and extract valuable insights to guide Bolly Movies in planning their new project. The analysis will cover various aspects such as table exploration, movie release trends, production statistics, genre popularity, ratings analysis, crew members, and more.

Segment 1: Database - Tables, Columns, Relationships
(a)	What are the different tables in the database and how are they connected to each other in the database?

Answer: The different tables are: 
(i)Genre Table: Columns: movie_id (foreign key referencing movie.id), genre. Relationships: Connected to the Movie table through movie_id. 

(ii) Ratings Table: Columns: movie_id (foreign key referencing movie.id), avg_rating, total_votes, median_rating 
Relationships: Connected to the Movie table through movie_id. 

(iii) Movie Table: Columns: id, title, year, date_published, duration, country, worldwide_gross_income, languages, production_company Relationships: No explicit foreign key relationships mentioned, but it seems to be the central table. 

(iv) Role Mapping Table: Columns: movie_id (foreign key referencing movie.id), name_id (foreign key referencing names.id), category 
Relationships: Connected to the Movie and Names tables through movie_id and name_id, respectively. 

(v) Director Mapping Table: Columns: movie_id (foreign key referencing movie.id), name_id (foreign key referencing names.id)
Relationships: Connected to the Movie and Names tables through movie_id and name_id, respectively. 

(vi) Names Table: Columns: id, name, height, date_of_birth, known_for_movies Relationships: No explicit foreign key relationships mentioned, but it seems to be related to Role Mapping and Director Mapping tables through id. 
           It appears that the central table is the Movie Table, and other tables like Genre, Ratings, Role Mapping, Director Mapping, and Names are connected to it through foreign keys.

(b)	Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema.

Answer: Total no. of rows in each table of the schema is as follows:

(i) Genre Table: 14662

(ii) Ratings Table: 7976

(iii) Movie Table: 7997 

(iv) Role Mapping Table: 15615

(v) Director Mapping Table: 3867

(vi) Names Table: 25735

(c)	Identify which columns in the movie table have null values.
